# AdventOfCode
My repo for the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) competitions hosted every year. Languages used for each year:
- 2023: Python
- 2024: Golang

## How to Run
- cd into `<year>` folder so that the file has access to the input files.  TODO: Look up better way to do this in go
- execute `go run day<n>/code.go`. 
  - E.g., for 2024 day 1, this would be: `go run day1/code.go`
